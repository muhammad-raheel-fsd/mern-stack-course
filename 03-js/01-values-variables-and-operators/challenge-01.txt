Grade Calculator
Your tasks:

Store a student's score in a variable score.
Use an if...else statement to assign a grade based on the score:
If the score is 90 or above, print "Grade A".
If the score is between 80 and 89, print "Grade B".
If the score is between 70 and 79, print "Grade C".
Otherwise, print "Grade D".
Test data:

Data 1: score = 85
